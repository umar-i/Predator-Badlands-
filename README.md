# Predator: Badlands Simulation

A multi-agent AI simulation set on the hostile planet Kalisk. This project follows the story of Dek, a young exiled Predator who must prove himself by defeating an ultimate adversary, with help from Thia, a damaged synthetic android.

## What This Project Does

This simulation models intelligent agents navigating a dangerous environment. Predators hunt, synthetics provide support, and creatures threaten survival. The system tracks honour, resources, and survival across turn-based gameplay.

Key features:
- 20x20 grid environment with varied terrain
- Multiple agent types (Predators, Synthetics, Monsters)
- Honour and reputation system based on Yautja Clan Code
- Resource management (health, stamina, energy)
- Adaptive AI behaviour and learning

## Project Structure

```
src/          - Main source code
tests/        - Unit tests
docs/         - Design diagrams and documentation
data/         - Simulation output and logs
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- No external AI frameworks (core algorithms implemented from scratch)

## How to Run

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Development

This project uses Git for version control. Each major feature gets its own commit with a clear message describing what changed and why.

Coding style:
- Clean, readable code without excessive comments
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Object-oriented design
- PEP 8 conventions

## Assessment Context

Built for CPS5002 Artificial Intelligence module. The simulation demonstrates problem-solving, AI programming skills, and understanding of multi-agent systems.
